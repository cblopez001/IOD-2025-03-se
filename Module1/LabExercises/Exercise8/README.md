# Module 1 Lab 8 - JavaScript Dice

You have been hired by devsInc to create a landing page for their new project. They want to support people playing tabletop games from home and require a Dice Generator.

Features:

1. The user should be able to choose different dice, such as a D6 or a D10 (number of faces).
2. The user should be able to roll their chosen dice to see the random outcome.
   
Tasks:

1. Define on paper, all the user stories (functionalities) you will need for this page.
2. Make a simple storyboard of the user using the system.
3. Create a GitHub repository for the project.
4. Clone the project locally.
5. Work on the project creating two (2) branches, one for the UI, and one for rolling the dice, committing and merging when completed.
6. Create the roll dice function by passing an argument, in order to reutilize the same function multiple times.
7. Write unit tests for the roll dice function.
8. When complete, push the content to your GitHub repository.
