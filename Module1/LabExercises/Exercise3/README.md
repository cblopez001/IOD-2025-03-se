# Module 1, Lab 3 - HTML, CSS, JS

Using index.html as a starter:

1. Add an image to each column.
2. Add a Change Me button under each heading.
3. Style your buttons with CSS.
4. Add a script tag with two JavaScript functions, one for each button.
5. Clicking each button should change the background color and the heading text for that column.
   
> Extensions: 
> Add text fields under the headings and replace the heading text with the value of the text fields when the buttons are clicked!
> Move the CSS and JS code into external files linked from the HTML
