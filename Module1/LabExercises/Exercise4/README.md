# Module 1 Lab 4 - JavaScript Functions

Use the learnings from this lesson to design some very simple functions. Call them with different values.
1. Create four (4) functions for the four (4) main mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `รท`). Return the calculated value and then output it to the screen.
2. Create a function that takes the name of a person as an argument, and prints out `Hello, <name>` to the console.
